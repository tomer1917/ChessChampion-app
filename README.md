#ChessChampion App

#Overview

ChessChampion is an advanced offline chess application that allows users to fully customize the game experience.

This allows players to create their own chess variants and experiment with different game rules.

#Features

- Custom Piece Movements & Attacks: Define unique movement rules and attack patterns for each piece.
- Offline Gameplay: The app is completely offline, ensuring no distractions or network dependencies.
- Basic User Login (Airplane Mode Required): While the app includes a Firebase authentication system, it is currently inactive. Players must be in airplane mode when logging in to avoid authentication errors.
